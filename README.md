This is the official code repository following our work [DermSynth3D](#link-to-arxiv).

## TL;DR

A data generation pipeline for creating photorealistic _in-the-wild_  synthetic dermatalogical data with rich annotations such as semantic segmentation masks, depth maps, and bounding boxes for various skin analysis tasks.

![main pipeline](assets/pipeline.png) 
>_The figure shows the DermSynth3D computational pipeline where 2D segmented skin conditions are blended into the texture image of a 3D mesh on locations outside of the hair and clothing regions. After blending, 2D views of the mesh are rendered with a variety of camera viewpoints and lighting conditions and combined with background images to create a synthetic dermatology dataset._

## Motivation

In recent years, deep learning (DL) has shown great potential in the field of dermatological image analysis.
However, existing datasets in this domain have significant limitations, including a small number of image samples, limited disease conditions, insufficient annotations, and non-standardized image acquisitions.
To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel framework called ${DermSynth3D}$.

${DermSynth3D}$ blends skin disease patterns onto 3D textured meshes of human subjects using a differentiable renderer and generates 2D images from various camera viewpoints under chosen lighting conditions in diverse background scenes.
Our method adheres to top-down rules that constrain the blending and rendering process to create 2D images with skin conditions that mimic *in-the-wild* acquisitions, resulting in more meaningful results.
The framework generates photo-realistic 2D dermoscopy images and the corresponding dense annotations for semantic segmentation of the skin, skin conditions, body parts, bounding boxes around lesions, depth maps, and other 3D scene parameters, such as camera position and lighting conditions.
${DermSynth3D}$ allows for the creation of custom datasets for various dermatology tasks.

<!-- Existing datasets for dermatological image analysis have significant limitations, including a small number of image samples, limited disease conditions, insufficient annotations, and non-standardized image acquisitions.
To address this problem, we propose **DermSynth3D**, or generating synthetic 2D skin image datasets using 3D human body meshes blended with skin disorders from clinical images.
Our approach uses a differentiable renderer to blend the skin lesions within the texture image of the 3D human body and generates 2D views along with corresponding annotations, including semantic segmentation masks for skin conditions, healthy skin, non-skin regions, and anatomical regions. 
Moreover, we include a diverse range of skin tones and background scenes, that enables us to generate semantically rich and meaningful labels for 2D _in-the-wild_ clinical images that can be used for a variety of dermatological tasks, as opposed to just one. -->

<!-- The 2D dermatological images generated using DermSynth3D are:
- meaningful _i.e._ anatomically relevant
- mimic _in-the-wild_ acquistions
- photo-realistic
- densely annotated with
  - Semantic segmentation labels of healthy skin, skin-condition, and human anatomy
  - Bounding boxes around skin-condition
  - Depth maps
  - 3D scene parameters, such as camera position and lightning conditions -->

## How to Use DermSynth3D

<a name='gen'></a>

### Generating Synthetic Dataset 

![annots](./assets/AnnotationOverview.png)
  > _A few examples of annotated data synthesized using DermSynth3D. The rows from top to bottom show respectively: the rendered images with blended skin conditions, bounding boxes around the lesions, GT semantic segmentation masks, grouped anatomical labels, and the monocular depth maps produced by the renderer._

Before running any code to synthesize a densely annotated data as shown above, make sure that you have downloaded the data necessary for blending as mentioned in [datasets](#data-for-blending) and folder structure is as described above.
If your folder structure is different from ours, then update the paths $-$ such as `bodytex_dir`, `annot_dir`, etc.$-$ accordingly in `configs/blend.yaml`.

<!-- ```yml
bodytex_dir: './data/3dbodytex-1.1-highres/' # Name of the mesh to blend
mesh_name: '006-f-run'                       # Path to FitzPatrick17k lesions
fitz_dir: './data/fitzpatrick17k/data/finalfitz17k/' # Path to annotated Fitz17k lesions with masks
annot_dir: './data/annotations/' # Path to save the new texture maps
tex_dir: './data/lesions/' 
``` -->

Now, to *generate* the synthetic data with the default parameters, simply run the following command to generate 2000 views for a specified mesh:

```bash
python -u scripts/gen_data.py
```

To change the blending or synthesis parameters only, run using:
```bash
# Use python scripts/gen_data.py -h for full list of arguments
python -u scripts/gen_data.py --lr <learning rate> \ 
            -m <mesh_name> \
            -s <path to save the views> \
            -ps <skin threshold> \
            -i <blending iterations> \
            -v <number of views> \
            -n <number of lesions per mesh> 
```

Feel free to play around with other `random` parameter in `configs/blend.yaml` to control lighting, material and view points.

### Post-Process Renderings with Unity 

We use Pytorch3D as our choice of differential renderer to generate synthetic data. 
However, Pytorch3D is not a Physically Based Renderer (PBR) and hence, the renderings are not photorealistic or may not look photorealistic.
To achieve photorealistic renderings, we use Unity to post-process the renderings obtained from Pytorch3D.

</details>

<span style="color:red">NOTE</span>: This is an optional step. If you are not interested in creating photorealistic renderings, you can skip this step and use the renderings obtained from Pytorch3D directly. We didn't observe a **significant** difference in the performance of the models trained on the renderings obtained from Pytorch3D and Unity.

<!-- We provide detailed instructions to post-process the renderings obtained in the previous step to achieve _photorealistic_ renderings using Unity. -->

## Preparing Dataset for Experiments
<!--

>_Generated synthetic images of multiple subjects across a range of skin tones in various skin conditions, background scene, lighting, and viewpoints._ -->

After creating the syntheic dataset in the previous step, it is now the time to evaluate the utility of the dataset on some real-world tasks.

Before, you start with any experiments, ideally you would want to organize the generated data into `train/val/test` sets.
We provide a utility script to do the same:
```bash
python scripts/prep_data.py
```

You can look at `scripts/prep_data.py` for more details.

### Lesion Segmentation
**Note**: Update the paths to relevant datasets in `configs/train_mix.yaml`.

To train a lesion segmentation model with default parameters, on a combination of Synthetic and Real Data, simply run:

```bash
python -u scripts/train_mix_seg.py
```

Play around with the following parameters for a combinatorial mix of datasets.
```yaml
real_ratio: 0.5                 # fraction of real images to be used from real dataset
real_batch_ratio: 0.5           # fraction of real samples in each batch
pretrain: True                  # use pretrained DeepLabV3 weights
mode: 1.0                       # Fraction of the number of synthetic images to be used for training
```

You can also look at [this notebook](./notebooks/train_segmentation.ipynb) for a quick overview for training lesion segmention model.

For inference of pre-trained models/checkpoints, look at [this notebook](./notebooks/inference_segmentation.ipynb).

### Multi-Task Prediction

We also train a multi-task model for predicting lesion, anatomy and depth, and evaluate it on multiple datasets.

For a quick overview of multi-task prediction task, checkout [this notebook](./notebooks/inference_multitask.ipynb).

For performing inference on your trained models for this task. First update the paths in `configs/multitask.yaml`. Then run:
```bash
python -u scripts/infer_multi_task.py
```
